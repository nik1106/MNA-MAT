## Unreleased

### September 5th, 2016

### Added
- In __MonteCarlo.m__, seperate distribution choices for resistors and capacitors. 
- In __MonteCarlo.m__, option to keep resistor or capacitor values fixed at each run.

### Changed
- In __MonteCarlo.m__, the uniform distribution for resistors and capacitors is now continuous rather than discrete.

### September 16th, 2016

### Added
- __Inductors__ can now be used in the SPICE netlist.
- __Current controlled voltage sources (H)__ can now be used in the SPICE netlist.
- __Current controlled current sources (F)__ can now be used in the SPICE netlist.

### Changed
- Removed unnecessary loops to improve speed.

### September 18th, 2016

### Added
- Axes labels for transient plots.

### Changed

### September 20th, 2016

### Added
- New example SPICE netlist (example11.cir) with associated schematic (example11.png), a complex RLC circuit.

### Changed
